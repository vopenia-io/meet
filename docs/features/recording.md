# Room Recording (Beta)

La Suite Meet offers a room recording feature that is currently in beta, with ongoing improvements planned. 

The feature allows users to record their room sessions. When a recording is complete, the room owner receives a notification with a link to download the recorded file. Recordings are automatically deleted after `RECORDING_EXPIRATION_DAYS`.

It uses LiveKit Egress to record room sessions. For reference, see the [LiveKit Egress repository](https://github.com/livekit/egress) and the [official documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/home/egress/overview/).

**Current Limitations**:

* Users cannot record and transcribe simultaneously. ([Issue #527](https://github.com/suitenumerique/meet/issues/527)
 is on our backlog)
* Recording layout cannot be configured from the frontend. By default, the egress captures the active speaker and any shared screens. (not yet planned)
* Shareable links with an embedded video player are not yet supported. (not yet planned)

## Special requirements

To use the room recording feature, the following components are required:

- A running [LiveKit Egress](https://github.com/livekit/egress) server capable of handling room composite recordings.
- A S3-compatible object storage where the egress uploads the recorded files.
- An email service to notify room owners when a recording is available for download.
- Webhook events configured between LiveKit Server and the backend.


> [!NOTE]
> Celery isn’t in use for these async tasks yet. It’s something we’d like to add, but it’s not planned at this stage.

## LiveKit Egress

La Suite Meet uses LiveKit Egress to record room sessions. For reference, see the [LiveKit Egress repository](https://github.com/livekit/egress) and the [official documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/home/egress/overview/).

Currently, only `RoomCompositeEgress` is supported. This mode combines all video and audio tracks from the room into a single recording.

To monitor egress workers and inspect recording status, it is recommended to install `livekit-cli`. For example, you can list active egress sessions using the following command:

```bash
$ livekit-cli list-egress

Using default project meet
+-----------------+---------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------+-------+
|    EGRESSID     |    STATUS     |      TYPE      |                SOURCE                |           STARTED AT           | ERROR |
+-----------------+---------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------+-------+
| EG_XXXXXXXXXXXX | EGRESS_ACTIVE | room_composite | your-room-name-XXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXX | 2024-07-05 18:11:37.073847924  |       |
|                 |               |                |                                      | +0200 CEST                     |       |
+-----------------+---------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------+-------+
```

This allows you to verify which recordings are in progress, troubleshoot egress issues, and confirm that recordings are being processed correctly.

## Tuning recording encoding

Every video recording is encoded from a default resolved from `RECORDING_ENCODING_DEFAULT_PROFILE` + `RECORDING_ENCODING_DEFAULT_RESOLUTION` and passed to LiveKit as advanced `EncodingOptions`. The shipped defaults (`full` profile) match LiveKit's built-in `H264_720P_30` preset. For a one-hour meeting that produces a file of roughly **1.4 GB**, which is often heavier than necessary for talking-head content and screen sharing; lowering the default profile/resolution shrinks it. If either default is left unset, no custom default encoding is built: a warning is logged at startup and LiveKit's built-in preset is used instead.

Encoding is chosen from two maps: `RECORDING_ENCODING_AVAILABLE_RESOLUTIONS` (`resolution → {"width", "height"}`) and `RECORDING_ENCODING_AVAILABLE_PROFILES` (`profile → {"fps", "kbps": {resolution: video_bitrate_kbps}}`):

- **Default**: `RECORDING_ENCODING_DEFAULT_PROFILE` + `RECORDING_ENCODING_DEFAULT_RESOLUTION` set the encoding used by every recording that doesn't override it. Leave either unset to fall back to LiveKit's built-in preset (a startup warning is emitted).
- **Per recording (opt-in)**: set `RECORDING_CUSTOM_ENCODING_ENABLED=True` to let clients override the default per recording. The start-recording API then accepts an `encoding` object selecting a `resolution` (required) and `profile` (optional): a resolution-only request keeps `RECORDING_ENCODING_DEFAULT_PROFILE` for fps and bitrate, so clients can only pick from pre-defined values. When `RECORDING_CUSTOM_ENCODING_ENABLED=False`, the API rejects any per-recording `encoding` and the default is used.

The resolved values are passed straight through LiveKit's `EncodingOptions.advanced` to the GStreamer pipeline (`x264enc` for video, `faac` for audio), so there are no hidden conversions — what the profile/resolution resolve to is what the encoder receives.

### How values map to GStreamer

| Resolved value                            | GStreamer element | Property                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| resolution `width` / `height`             | capsfilter        | `video/x-raw,width=W,height=H`     |
| profile `fps`                             | capsfilter        | `framerate=F/1`                    |
| profile `kbps[resolution]`                | `x264enc`         | `bitrate=kbps` (kilobits)          |
| `RECORDING_ENCODING_KEY_FRAME_INTERVAL_S` | `x264enc`         | `key-int-max = interval × fps`     |
| `RECORDING_ENCODING_AUDIO_BITRATE_KBPS`   | `faac`            | `bitrate = kbps × 1000` (bits)     |

The H.264 profile is fixed to MAIN and the x264 `speed-preset` to `veryfast` by LiveKit (real-time constraint) — lowering the framerate is therefore the main lever to save CPU, while lowering the bitrate is the main lever to shrink the output file.

### Built-in profiles

The default `RECORDING_ENCODING_AVAILABLE_PROFILES` ship four profiles. Framerate is fixed per profile; video bitrate (kbps) scales with resolution so quality stays consistent across sizes. File size scales roughly with `framerate × bitrate`, and so does egress CPU cost.

| Profile         | FPS | 540p (kbps) | 720p (kbps) | 1080p (kbps) | Suitable for                                       |
| --------------- | --- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `talking_heads` | 15  | 400         | 700         | 1200         | Talking-head dominant meetings + occasional slides |
| `text`          | 15  | 600         | 1000        | 1800         | Frequent dense screen sharing (decks, IDE, docs)   |
| `mixed`         | 20  | 900         | 1500        | 2500         | Mixed content, moderate motion                     |
| `full`          | 30  | 2000        | 3000        | 4500         | Highest fidelity; closest to the LiveKit default preset    |

To pick a profile per recording (requires `RECORDING_CUSTOM_ENCODING_ENABLED=True`), the client sends it in the start-recording request:

```json
{
  "mode": "screen_recording",
  "options": {"encoding": {"resolution": "720p", "profile": "talking_heads"}}
}
```

To change the default encoding applied to every recording:

```bash
RECORDING_ENCODING_DEFAULT_RESOLUTION=720p
RECORDING_ENCODING_DEFAULT_PROFILE=talking_heads
RECORDING_ENCODING_AUDIO_BITRATE_KBPS=64
RECORDING_ENCODING_KEY_FRAME_INTERVAL_S=4.0
```

### Caveats

- **Screen-share readability — think bits/frame, not bitrate**: at 720p, text legibility starts to break down below ~40 kbits/frame (= `bitrate ÷ framerate`). The `talking_heads` profile (700 kbps × 15 fps) sits just above that threshold, comfortable for talking heads with occasional slide sharing. The same bitrate at 30 fps would only deliver ~23 kbits/frame and visibly blur dense slides — which is why **lowering framerate is a more screen-share-friendly lever than lowering bitrate**. For deck-heavy or IDE-share meetings, prefer the **`text`** profile (1000 kbps × 15 fps ≈ 67 kbits/frame).
- **Motion handling**: the `veryfast` x264 preset is set by LiveKit and cannot be overridden here. Low-bitrate settings will therefore show more artefacts on fast motion than an offline re-encode with a slower preset would. This is the other reason FPS reduction is the safer tuning lever for meeting recordings.
- **Audio**: AAC at 64 kbps stereo is transparent for voice but starts to compress music noticeably. Keep 128 kbps if you expect music playback in meetings.
- **Codec choice**: H.264 MAIN is hardcoded on purpose. Switching to HEVC or VP9 would increase egress CPU cost 2×–5×, defeating the goal of this tuning.
