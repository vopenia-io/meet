We’re relentlessly focused on building the best open-source video conferencing product—La Suite Meet. Growth comes from creating something people truly need, not just from chasing metrics.

Our users come first. We’re committed to making La Suite Meet as accessible and easy to use as proprietary solutions, ensuring it meets the highest standards.

Most of the heavy engineering is handled by the incredible LiveKit team, allowing us to focus on delivering a top-tier product. We follow extreme programming practices, favoring pair programming and quick, iterative releases. Challenge our tech and architecture—simplicity is always our top priority.
